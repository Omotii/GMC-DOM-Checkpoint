In this DOM Checkpoint, I created a one-page e-commerce website with 4 pres-selected items.

AT the header section of this site, users should be able to input suggestion and on-clicking the button or pressing enter on the keyboard this suggestion would reflect on the right-hand aside of the web-page, just belong the CART Summary. Actually, this is supposed to be a search bar where users can search for other items on the site. But the idea of replacing it with a suggestion bar is just to put what i learnt into practice.

Furthermore, users can increase the quantity of the pre-selected goods or reduce it as preferred and at the right hand side, the CART SUMMARY bar accumulates the prices to be paid. The qunatity can be increased upwards but on the reduction, it is limited to 1 item.
User may also decide to delete or add such items to favorites.

Below is an e-mail bar with hope to send future market updates via email to client who are visiting probably for the first time.
